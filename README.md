# Breathing.app
I made this app so you can relax after a long day of syntax errors and your network carrier putting you on a 2 hour hold. 

### Functionality:
* Breathing animation
* Inhale/Exhale text
* Cute cats button!!

I decided to add the cute cats button because I have 5 cats. Maybe I'll add a cute dogs button next?
The button uses TheCatAPI to find cats and put them in.

I feel like I should also say this: I rawdogged this. I did not watch any movies, listen to music. **Nothing**, nada.
I almost crashed out because I hate Javascript. Someone make a JS replacement. Please.

Here's a screenshot!!!

Anyways, hope you enjoy this app and that it makes you relax after a long day.
